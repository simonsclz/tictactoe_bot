# tictactoe_bot
A collection of three TicTacToe-bots, each on a different level (easy, mid, hard).

tictactoe.c: main-source. Compile and execute to play.
*.h: outsourced files and modules for different tasks. E.g.: "ttt_eingabe.h" is for input, "ttt_ausgabe.h" to print the grid.

BOTS:
easy: just uses random numbers. Easy to win against.
mid: uses algorithms to block and force a move. Very hard to win against.
hard: does not play the way the game is meant to be played. Bot wins all the time. (just for fun!)
